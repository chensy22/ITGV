# ITGV:An Interactive Teaching Gesture Video Dataset in Real Classroom

We constructed an Interactive Teaching Gesture Video Dataset (ITGV) in which the classification attributes of teacher gestures are defined by the interaction between the gestures and the surrounding environment. ITGV dataset contains 2,908 video samples, covering 8 subjects and 8 typical teacher gesture behaviors. To our best knowledge, it is the largest teacher gesture dataset.
